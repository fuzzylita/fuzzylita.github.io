<p>Molecular Biologist turned Product Manager turning Engineer from San Francisco. I love science, technology, and eating. I work for Rainforest QA, home of the best darn team of intelligent humans I've met. These are the electrifying, death-defying tales of my transition from PM to Engineer, probably with some food-chat thrown in to mix it up a touch. </p>
