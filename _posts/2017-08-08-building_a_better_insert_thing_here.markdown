I *love* to create things.
I waste an embarassing number of hours that really should be spent reading a book, or exercising, or calling my mother, but instead I'm doing the following (listed in order of total embarrassing numbers of hours):

* Cooking 
* Baking
* Making cocktails
* Cultivating plants
* Planning more elaborate plans for the above four

A lot of my creations really suck at first. 

I find myself offended by the suckful creation (which clearly sucks through no fault of its own). I flail around, and rage-create a new version of the suckful thing until I have something that doesn't suck. Everyone needs a hobby.

I started in Molecular Biology - the professional equivalent to my first 'real' relationship. It's very cool. Very like my hobbies. You grind away to understand the inner workings of biological systems, and in practice, you use what you know to interact with proteins in living cells. It rarely works the first time, but when it does, it's pretty magical. I felt like Harry Potter. 

Alas, professional application is always different. I was a good molecular biologist, but my skill was essentially defined by how well I could do the same thing every day, after day... after day.

5 years in, I went a little...

and slowly came to realize that I was in the wrong place for a lifelong career.

Many of my friends are engineers. I saw the things they were working on, and I was envious. So many cool things to make. So many dryly hilarious programs, inside jokes, and stupid nonsense you can create, just for the lols. 

(I mean, come on. [This](http://terriblecolors.com/) is sheer brilliance.)

A job opportunity at a startup presented itself, and while I had no experience at all, I pulled the trigger, and moved to the tech industry. I started on the customer facing side, but quickly moved to Product Management, a little closer to the making-stuff side of the company. I was pretty good and I liked it, but it was never quite enough. I wanted to build stuff. 

I loved learning about what the engineers were working on. I would stalk their PRs, sneak into their meetings and read their tech specs to better understand what went on under the hood. I asked them to explain their projects to a far more technical degree than I needed to do my job. I wanted to do their jobs.

I decided to start coding, just to see if I'd be genuinely terrible at it. I began learning through experienced friends and online coding programs, and got a feel for what it's like... You make terrible, *terrible* mistakes. You sometimes bash your head against an intellectual brick wall. You feel like the biggest idiot ever.

Then... the magic happens. You figure out the honestly simple roadblock you hit. You feel like the smartest person in the world. You create a platypus with JavaScript.

Elation. You share your triumph with everyone. They respond somewhere on the spectrum from amusement to confusion to disappointment. 

You don't care. You know you're the smartest person in the world. You blaze into the next thing. You are suddenly an idiot again. IT'S GREAT.

I want to create things that maybe kinda suck at first, then make them suck less, until they're pretty good.
I want to be an engineer.
