I *love* to create things.

I waste an embarassing number of hours that really should be spent reading a book, or exercising, or calling my mother, but instead I'm doing the following (listed in order of total embarrassing numbers of hours):

* Cooking 
* Baking
* Making cocktails
* Cultivating plants
* Planning the next, more elaborate idea for the above four

A lot of my creations really suck at first. 

I'm always annoyed by my first suckful attempts. I flail around, and rage-create the next, (hopefully) better version of the suckful thing until I have something that doesn't suck. Everyone needs a hobby.

I started in Molecular Biology - the professional equivalent to my first 'real' relationship. It's very cool. Very like my hobbies. You grind away to understand the inner workings of biological systems, and in practice, you use what you know to interact with proteins in living cells. Things rarely work the first (or second, or tenth) time, but when they do, it's truly magical.  

I'm a good molecular biologist - theoretical and practical - but in practice, my day-to-day success was defined by how well I could do the same thing in exactly the same way. Over and over... and over.

5 years into my professional life, I found myself feeling uncontrollably...

and came to realize that I was not in the right place for a fulfilling lifelong career.

Many of my friends are software engineers, working on really interesting problems (and a few frivolous ones). I was envious of their work and their technical know-how. So many cool things they could make. So many dryly hilarious programs, inside jokes, and stupid nonsense they could build on a whim, just for the lols. 

(I mean, come on. [This](http://terriblecolors.com/) is sheer brilliance.)

When a great opportunity presented itself, I decided it was fate and dove headfirst into the tech world. I started in a customer-facing role, but I quickly moved to Product Management, a little closer to the making-stuff side of the company. I did pretty well at it, but it was never quite enough. I still wanted to build things. 

I wanted to learn what the engineers were doing. I would stalk their PRs, sneak into their meetings and read their tech specs to learn how our product really worked. I asked them to explain their projects down to the nuts and bolts, *far* more technical than I needed in order to do my job. I loved their work. I wanted to be part of the action.

I decided to start coding, to see if I'd actually enjoy it. I began learning through experienced friends and online coding programs, and got a feel for what it's really like... 

You make terrible, *terrible* mistakes. You sometimes bash your head against an intellectual brick wall. You feel like the biggest idiot ever.

Then... the magic happens. You figure out the usually simple roadblock you hit. You feel like the smartest person in the world. You create a platypus with JavaScript.

Elation. You share your triumph with everyone, eliciting responses somewhere on the spectrum from mild amusement to confusion to disappointment. 

You don't care. You're the smartest person in the world. You blaze forth into the next thing... You are suddenly an idiot again. You cry a little. 

IT'S AWESOME.

I want to create things that maybe kinda suck at first, then make them suck less, until they're pretty good.
