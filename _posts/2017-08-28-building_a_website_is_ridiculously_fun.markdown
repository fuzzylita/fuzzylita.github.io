HTML and CSS are pretty fun! Before you even say anything, I know that HTML and CSS are to learning to code as making a box of Kraft Mac and Cheese is to learning to cook.

That said, the very first time you serve up a sticky heap of that not-found-in-nature orange glory, don't tell me you weren't proud. Best damned mac and cheese ever, even if your milk was spoiled so you used watered down yogurt (Don't pretend you haven't been there. It's still ok!) Well, the pride was the same! 

Messing with the web in real time is a genuine joy. There's something IMMENSELY satisfying about poking away in a text file, mashing refresh, and seeing your own inside joke come to life (or something more high-minded and useful). It's obvious to me why so many people are suddenly hooked by the instant gratification.

Admittedly, I went slightly off the rails on this exercise, but I followed the SPIRIT of the instruction! 

This specific set of exercises worked us through coding along with the pleasant and skilled instructor, ultimately producing a simple, faux-realtor's website. Admittedly, I went slightly off the rails on this exercise, but I followed the SPIRIT of the instruction!

It was actually a great series of lesssons. Very straightforward to follow for anyone of any skill level, but really hits all of the key points and brought home what you were doing, why, and how it worked. Every bit of context you could want was well explained, and the pacing and buildup of increasingly complex concepts were great.

So, we're making this website, everything's going well and we're asked to push in a nice, reasonable image for our 'homepage' to display. Some reasonably tasteful, approachably modern living room. 

Alas, I just can't color within the lines, so seized the opportunity for absurdity, which I don't *think* was the point of the exercise. I found a silly image of a duck and a chicken, went completely off the rails, and Chicken Realtor Group was born.

My realty site ended up being thinly veiled anti-duck propaganda from the sinister chickens. Rife with hilarious, shady duck images on every page, useful information punctuated with an constant reminder. You can't trust the ducks.

That said, becuase I wanted my joke to be funnier - to me... no one else is ever even going to see the outcome of this exercise - I ended up learned 5 times more than I could have.

'I want the duck with sunglasses to be positioned dfferently, and how do I skip a line? hmm there's no space between the links to '100 sketchy duck facts'. Why doesn't that stupid selector work?'

In the end, I created something astonishingly stupid, but MAN was it fun, and I did learn a lot more about wrangling HTML and CSS than I expected. 

Front-end stuff is pretty fun. I can't wait to try JavaScript.
