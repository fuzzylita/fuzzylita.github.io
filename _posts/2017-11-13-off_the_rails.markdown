The project of doom. Rails is a huge topic, and I get that. Still there were some requirements that were awfully tough to meet, as the content of the section had to be compacted for sanity and timely completion, and certain functionality in Rails is honestly not very well documented. 

The rest of this will come later but placeholder etc etc
