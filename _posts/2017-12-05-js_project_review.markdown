I'm not doing it this time. I'm not starting out my blog with the same paragraph, expressing my lack of confidence in my familiarity with the material, not going to talk about how it came together surprisingly and I retained more than I thought. If you want to know, you can read the first paragraph of [any](http://litastephenson.com/2017/09/15/bringing_it_all_together/) of my [other]https://learn.co/blog/blog_posts/8623/edit) project [posts](http://litastephenson.com/off_the_rails). Have a good time, it goes like this:

* OMG I KNOW NOTHING
* I'M GONNA TOTALLY FAIL AT THIS PROJECT, THIS IS THE END
* OH IT'S DONE.

YAY. üç∫
