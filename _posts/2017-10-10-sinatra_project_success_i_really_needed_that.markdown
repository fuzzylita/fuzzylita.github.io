The struggle was real with the SQL/ORM/Rack/Sinatra section of the Flatiron program. 
I bogged down badly in several parts, and many of the last labs were multiple day affairs. 

There were tears.

Aggressive though it may be, I'm behind on my timeline, due to my... optimistic expectations of this section. I was both rushed and discouraged going in to the final project, after my slow pace with the last few labs. (PLAYLISTER Y U DO DIS?!)

Thankfully, the project was a real breath of fresh air. Similar to my CLI data gem, I had the tremendous good fortune of a solid, well defined idea going in, and one that aligned easily with the project requirements.

We were tasked with building a simple content management system which must:
  1. Follow the Sinatra MVC structure
  2. Demonstrate complex(ish) relationships between objects
  3. Support all standard CRUD functionality
  4. Support some form of data validation
  5. Support some basic permissions-based functionality
  6. Support secure (heavy air-quotes) user Login/Logout

In keeping with the theme of my first project, I decided to build a collaborative cocktail database. In essence, it's a public recipe book for cocktails, including ingredients and instructions. Users signup, and - when logged in - could access and manipulate their own cocktail creations, as well as viewing permissions to a complete public list of all drinks and drink ingredients submitted by their fellow users.

The project was a relative breeze, and I genuinely enjoyed making my app. I'm pretty proud of the outcome!

:

1. Holy bananas, let me tell you about Corneal. Whoever made this project is a saint. One gem install later, and I had the complete framework in place, including gems, placeholders for my migrations, the complete file tree and all of the associated Model/View/Controller folders for every table. EVEN THE INHERITENCE OMGGGG. CRUD in a box.
2. My plan for my app was very closely aligned with the project structure and relationships we build out in the earlier, (and BRUTALLY PAINFUL) playlister project, but as a result, the workflow for mine was quite intuitive. All in all, it took me about 12 horus to complete. ... probably less than playlister :}
3. the actual structure of the app was quite simple, I only found that I bogged down when I got into some trouble with Flash
