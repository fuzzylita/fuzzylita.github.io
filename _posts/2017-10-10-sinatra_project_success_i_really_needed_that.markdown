I had an incredibly difficult time with the SQL/ORM/Rack/Sinatra section of the Flatiron program. I bogged down badly in several parts, and many of the last labs were multiple day affairs. 

There were tears.

I'm behind on my timeline, and was both rushed and intimidated going in, especially after my slow pace with the last few labs. Thankfully, I quickly came around when I actually started the project. Similar to my CLI data gem, I had the tremendous good fortune to have a pretty solid idea going in, and one that aligned nicely with the project requirements.

I decided to build a collaborative cocktail database. Essentially a public recipe book for cocktail ingredients and instructions. Users signup, and - when logged in (the pain of validating user logins came later ... I blame Rack::Flash) - could access both their own cocktail creations, and a public list of all drinks and drink ingredients submitted by their fellow users.

The project was a relative breeze, and I genuinely enjoyed making my app. I'm pretty proud of the outcome!

Here are the steps that I went through to complete this project:

1. Holy bananas, let me tell you about Corneal. Whoever made this project is a saint. One gem install later, and I had the complete framework in place, including gems, placeholders for my migrations, the complete file tree and all of the associated Model/View/Controller folders for every table. EVEN THE INHERITENCE OMGGGG. CRUD in a box.
2. My plan for my app was very closely aligned with the project structure and relationships we build out in the earlier, (and BRUTALLY PAINFUL) playlister project, but as a result, the workflow for mine was quite intuitive. All in all, it took me about 12 horus to complete. ... probably less than playlister :}
3. the actual structure of the app was quite simple, I only found that I bogged down when I got into some trouble with Flash
